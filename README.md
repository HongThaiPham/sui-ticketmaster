# Sui Ticketmaster â€“ Decentralized Ticketing System

## Overview

**Sui Ticketmaster** is a decentralized ticketing platform built on the [Sui blockchain](https://sui.io/), inspired by Ticketmaster. It leverages blockchain technology to provide transparent, secure, and fair ticket distribution, resale, and validation for events. Each ticket is represented as an NFT (Non-Fungible Token), ensuring authenticity and preventing fraud or double-selling.

## Features

- **Event Creation:** Event organizers can create and manage events on-chain.
- **NFT Ticket Minting:** Tickets are minted as NFTs, uniquely representing each seat or entry.
- **Primary Sales:** Users can purchase tickets directly from event organizers.
- **Secondary Market:** Safe peer-to-peer ticket resale with optional royalty enforcement.
- **On-Chain Ownership:** All ticket transfers and ownership are transparent and verifiable.
- **Ticket Validation:** Tickets can be marked as used upon entry, preventing reuse.
- **Fraud Prevention:** Blockchain provenance eliminates counterfeiting and double-spending.
- **Scalable & User-Friendly:** Optimized for a smooth user experience, abstracting blockchain complexity where possible.

## Architecture

### (Sui / Move Smart Contracts)

- **Event Object:** Contains event details (organizer, name, date, location, ticket supply).
- **Ticket NFT:** Each ticket is a unique Move object, with seat/info, owner, and status.
- **Modules:**
  - Event creation and management
  - Ticket minting, transferring, validation (mark as used)
  - Secondary market logic (resale, royalties)
